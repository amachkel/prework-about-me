      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a wife and mom of two wonderful kids, and I'm ready for a major career change!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've spent the majority of my life in the Metro Atlanta area and am currently enjoying the suburbs of Sharpsburg.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy doing home improvement projects and trying out new recipes. I enjoy the occasional video game.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The ability to work from anywhere and to have the opportunity for continuous growth would be ideal. I'd love to work for a company that values a healthy work/life balance and invests in their workers.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sharpsburg, Georgia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I grew up in a home full of spare computer parts. My dad loved tinkering and building computers. He became a technical trainer for Pitney Bowes and works with their software. When my husband became a programmer, I got to see the kind of projects getting worked on. It piqued my interest. Once I started looking into the field, it became more and more appealing. I love that things are always changing and there's always more to learn. I love that there are so many avenues I could pursue. And I love that it reminds me a bit of my childhood. </p>
